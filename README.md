Memory game

first gotta have a parent container for all of the cards.

gonna have six cards in total.

on click on one of the cards, the card has to remember that it has been clicked (so it must be an object then) , and then all of the cards have to be randomly rearranged.

somewhere there should be a score board, which reads succcesive guesses, and keeps a highscore.


when a card, who has been already chosen, gets chosen again, the scoreboard resets, the highscore persists and the cards rearrange again.

so each card is an object component.

and the app is the logic.

cards are simple.

no idea how to make the app render a random function on click.
